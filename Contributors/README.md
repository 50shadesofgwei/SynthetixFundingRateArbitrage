# Project Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the SynthetixFundingRateArbitrage contributors' section - we're excited to have you consider contributing to the project. Here you can find the types of contributions we are looking for and how the process works.

## Introduction

As an open source project, community contributions are highly encouraged - most opportunities are somewhat technical in nature, although there are also avenues for content-focused + organisational contributors. A list of the outstanding tasks, their category and their respective bounty are to be found below.

## Types of Contributions

- **Backend**: Exchange integrations
- **Frontend**: UI/UX designs, graphics, logos
- **Documentation**: Setup guides, architecture walkthroughs, execution flows etc
- **Testing**: Add a suite of unit/e2e tests
- **Community Support**: Answering questions, managing discussions, etc
- **Content**: Twitter threads, Articles, Youtube videos

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the project repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a Branch**: Make a new branch and give it a descriptive name.
4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature, bug fix, or other contribution.
5. **Run Tests**: Test edge cases - does it run? Does it handle errors appropriately?
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and then submit a pull request to the main project.

## Contribution Guidelines - Technical

- **Searcher Code**: Where applicable, all new code should follow the pre-existing module structure. Functions and classes should be given descriptive names, and include detailed error handling that shows from where the error originated and what the error is - this should also be logged to the main logger. If you're planning on contributing code and want to know more about style/structure expectations, join the telegram chat and discuss the planned changes/additions - you'll be able to get feedback and any details you may need.
-**Frontend/GUIs**: If you're planning on building a frontend/GUI, it'd be best to get in touch with the project in the telegram chat. 
- **Pull Request Process**: After the planned changes have been implemented on your local branch, submit the pull request for a review. Be prepared to jump on a call (or DMs, depending) and run through all the changes and motives behind them, etc.
